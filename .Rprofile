cat("Some tips for GIT: \n
     I can make a new branch and then commit to this branch and push before switching branches.
     Automatically there will be a local and a remote branch, which are completely independent. I can
     also just create a local branch without the remote counterpart. Remote is usually named origin. \n
     Then merge the branches by switching to the master branch and use the shell for 
     ´git merge --no-f name_of_branch´ it will ask for a commit message through the terminal, its possible
     to just close the window without saving and commit normally through RStudio. Then pull-push and delete
     the branch.\n
     To delete the local branch type git branch -d name_of_branch and to delete the remote branch 
     either go to github.com or type git push origin --delete name_of_branch.\n
     It is possible to update the RStudio branch list type git fetch -p. \n
     And a note about using GIT with TEXstudio: Any changes made in latex documents are tracked through
     GIT, so that I could simply go to RStudio and commit whenever I want to. This is better then
     commiting through TEXstudio which is also possible but clutters the repository...    ")
